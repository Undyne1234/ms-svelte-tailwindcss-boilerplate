# Sveltekit tailwind boilerplate

We use this Sveltekit and tailwind boilerplate throughout the whole course.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Packages and vulnerabilities
Unfortunately, at this moment there are still 3 vulnerabilities in all the used packages of this project. They are already mentioned as a bug in the Tailwind and Sveltekit repo. Hopefully, they will address them soon.
